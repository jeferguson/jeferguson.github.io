Hello, my name is Joshua Ferguson! This is the first website I've created, and I'm trying some stuff out.  Here is a link to my [facebook][Facebook] and feel free to follow me on [twitter][Twitter].

Also, here is some obligatory code that I am putting up just because this is my very first hello world post on the world wide web.  If you would like to see any of my other code, feel free to fork one of my (very few) repos on [github][GitHub].

{% highlight java %}

// prints hello world
private void hello_world(){
	System.out.println("hello world");
}
// main method
public static void main(String[] args) {
	hello_world();
}

{% endhighlight %}
